                    In 2020, I had the honor of winning the statewide content held by BeingWellCA . The goal of the contest was to design a license plate that encapsulates a message of mental health awareness. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since winning first place, my license plate has passed in the Senate and is going to the Assembly to receive an official bill. 
                    I have attend many press conferences and been able to make real change in the Mental Health community.

                    BeingwellCA's mission is to  reduce anxiety, depression and suicide ideation in our youth. We do this by providing schools, parents, students and communities with workshops, tool kits and trainings to improve mental health support. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sb 21 would create a Special Interest License Plate for the California  Department of Education (CDE).  The monies raised by the sale of these plates goes to improve youth mental health in our schools, reduce stigma and raise awareness.
