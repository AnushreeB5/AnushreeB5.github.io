                My inner passion for creation through multiple forms of media spans Code, Animation, UI, and more. Being able to receive accolades and recognition for different fields allows me to prove myself as a versatile worker in my academic and career journey.

                My goal is to be able to research how to create “Good Design”. I define this as a system of design principles that does not negatively affect its audience whether it be in the moment, long term, or anything in between.
