					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned more about the specfic metrics and details that come with animation in a technical sense. The article taught how the amount of time (ms) can change the effect and feel of your designs significantly. They show how you can combine traditional animation techniques like easing into even coded animation.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was how they showed visually each example in a gif. I think this really helped to visualize what they were explaining especially in the examples where they are comparing a good/bad test sequence. This way I could study and understand side-by-side how much of a difference can be made from one alteration.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> " It’s one of the essential principles of the animation, which is thoroughly described in the book The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation, written by two key Disney animators — Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas." </p>
						</li>
