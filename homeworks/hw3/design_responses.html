						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned a lot from this article, particularly about pairing fonts correctly, and scaling them according to the golden ratio. I think as those are instances where I always have to think a bit harder, having the article break down the concept was really nice. I learned how the Golden Ratio is implemented and how the Modular Scale Method can help to use math to make your choices precise. I really thought it was fascinating how there is a formula to the smallest parts of design, something that a user might never even realize. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite thing about the article was actually all the new resources they provided. I really appreciated how many links they gave along with their examples and definitions. As someone who learns with example or alongside someone, seeing a tool that can help this exact concept was really nice. I also appreciate it, since as a designer sometimes I need inspiration or references, and their links seem like something I will be using in the future. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "For this reason, before choosing a font, research its intended purpose."" </p>
