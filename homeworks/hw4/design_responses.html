						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about accessibility in design, and its integral importance to create a platform that can help an abundance of people. It is important to as they put, "not creating accessible products is just rude, so don't be rude". This article highlighted how giving options such as color accesibility, contrast, and color systems are so important to allowing a diverse range of users to be able to succesfully use the product.  </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the "don't rely soleyl on color" section. I think often we use color so much to define our work and make it creative and unique. However, explaining how color can be hindering and messages don't necessarily need color but rather other methods like iconography was very insightful. </p>
