						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the unique Gestalt principles in design and how to effeectivelly use them. it was helpful to revise these concepts and apply them to design that I am working on, and have seen in the past. Knowing how to implement these principles is very important to make your design more friendly and accessible and this article explained that well.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really liked how they showed the visuals for each example. I think for examples such as the Dalmation dog, it is easier to see the implementation of the principle in action, rather than just an explanation. I really liked how they also showed ways it is used, like the Common Fate principle at the bottom explains different use cases. </p>
