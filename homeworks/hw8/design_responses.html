					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> This article was helpful in teaching me about "Dark patterns". I have not heard this term before, but have seen this being used so many times, so it was helpful to learn what it actually is. I think dark patterns are a neat trick for designers, that might be annoying for users, but in the end is effective for the company itself. I learned how it can be used in  so many different  circumstances and how to recgonize them.  </p>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was how the article was able to show to many different examples. Disguied ads, forced continutity, hidden costs, and misdirection were only a few of the many examples the article showed to explain this concept. I really liked how they organized all these different cases and showed the image of how it could be used as well as a description.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> As Campbell-Dollaghan (2017) stated, we are entering a new era where we shouldnâ€™t be using dark patterns as weapons to influence our world.
