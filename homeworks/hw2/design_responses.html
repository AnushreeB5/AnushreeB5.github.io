							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article was really insightful in teaching me about the importance of white space/ padding. They discussed how white space even if left empty, is useful. They pushed the concept of how it leaves for a better user experience, and how that extra bit of padding gave breathing room to the design. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was "Users will scroll and scroll some more. I promise you. There is this myth that users will not always scroll to see all the content on a page." I think there is often a structure that designers follow, where we use the Thumb Zone template. This template reinforces the idea that users are limited in their movement, and won't be willing to step outside of the norm. This quote was really nice as it said no to that idea, and believes that users will put effort in for the content they want.</p>
