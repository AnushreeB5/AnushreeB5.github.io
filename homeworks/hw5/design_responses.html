                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned in this article was how to create appealing and succesfull transitions. I learned how transitions can vary and change the narrative of the work provided. It shows how diverse transition animations can be, and if used correctly, can display information is a unique way that makes it more acessible to the audience. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was how the animations were lined up throughout the page. The author showed how the work can almost speak for itself and does not need a description to follow. The content was so diverse in the range presented and I really liked to see how many different types of companies can utilize transitions in their own ways.  </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> Midnight hour was extremely impressive for the way they used the womans face and the black frame to push inbetween content. I assume this kind of content would be great for a modeling agency page or something where the focus is the profile of this woman, while the informatoin itself is simple and easy to scroll through. I also really liked Prism Studio for its way it shows first the art itself in a background overlayed with the text, then it scrolls through all the important home information. This was a great and quick way to see the brand, its dark and heavy style, but also the people who represent it.  </p>
