        <p> Hi everyone! I am a Junior here at UC Berkeley! I love Disney everything, traveling the world, and trying cool new foods. I also do competitive dancing, and have been doing so since I was 5 years old. You can usually find me binging New Girl in my room while painting, or just being lazy and scrolling on Tiktok :) </p>
        <h6> (I don't live in Berkeley so here are some food places I love in general lol) </h6>
        <ul> 
            <li> Gotta Eatta Pitta </li>
            <li> Pakwan </li>
            <li> Nandos </li>
        </ul>

        <ul> Something I learned from the article was the importance of subtlety. I never realized how many small things have gone unnoticed that a UI Designer once must have spent so much time to create. For example in Spotify, while you search around, the music is still playing and is shown at the bottom. </ul>
        <ul> My favorite part of the article was how the article was actually structured with GIFs to explain the process. It highlighted each UI item slowly, that way we as the audience could truly see how many action items are placed all over the screen.</ul>
        <ul>Know the rules, so you can break em</ul>
        <ul>9. I really enjoyed this article, it explained everything in such a simple and straight forward way. I would have loved to see a bit more of a breakdown possibly of their own work, or even a section where she provided tips possibly?</ul>
